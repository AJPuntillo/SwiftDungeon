### SWIFT DUNGEON GDD

**Andrew Puntillo**

# High Concept:
Swift Dungeon is a side-scrolling platformer. The player must make it to the end of the level without being killed off by falling slimes from the sky. The slimes fall at random intervals and explode at random times, making the game very tense getting from one side to another. When the player makes it to the end, the time is displayed as their final score.

# Genre:
- Sidescroller
- Platformer

# Theme:
- Pixel Art
- Fantasy
- 2D

# Mechanics:
- The player is controlled using a touch-joystick. The player can move left, right, and jump.
- Enemy slimes fall at different intervals with different velocities.
- The player can push the slimes around before they explode.
- Enemy slimes deal damage to the player on contact while exploding.
